How to deal with complex states 

- the best practice is to use the useState function multiple times to create seperate pieces of state 
- a components tate can be of any type 
- you can create copies of object using the {...clicks, right: right +1} syntax
    - here you are making a copy of the previous object and setting the variable right as something else 

In react you should only change the state by creating a new object, you shouldnt mutate the state 
directly 
- because of this you should use concat instead of push when dealing with arrays 

Conditional Rendering 
- use state hooks can only be called from inside a rect function body - not from inside aloop or codiional 

Event handlers must always be a function , a variable assignment or anything else wont work
- you cant have a function call as an eventh andler either 

Functions returning functions can be used in defining generic functionality that can be customised with parameters 
- so this works as a factory to create functions 

Never define components inside components
